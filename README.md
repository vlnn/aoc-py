These are my Advent of Code (AoC) puzzle solutions. I'm trying to learn python and get good understanding how good are different languages for different task. Also they may be used to compare the time budget that I'll publish for each solution. Thus repo could be used together with [aoc-clj](https://github.com/vlnn/aoc-clj) (and maybe others in future?).
